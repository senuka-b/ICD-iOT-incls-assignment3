                        The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: Ëê¨ÈáåÈï∑Âüé; simplified Chinese: ‰∏áÈáåÈïøÂüé; pinyin: W√†nl«ê
                        Ch√°ngch√©ng, literally "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications that were built
                        across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as
                        protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built
                        from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang
                        (220‚Äì206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many
                        successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known
                        sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644).
