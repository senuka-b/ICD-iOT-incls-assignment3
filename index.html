            <b>The New 7 Wonders of the World</b> was a campaign started in 2001 to choose Wonders of the World from a
            selection of 200 existing monuments.[1] The popularity poll via free web-based voting and telephone voting
            was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber and organized by the New 7 Wonders Foundation (N7W) based in Zurich,
            Switzerland, with winners announced on 7 July 2007 at Est√°dio da Luz in Lisbon.[2][3][4][5] The poll was
            considered unscientific partly because it was possible for people to cast multiple votes.[6] According to
            John Zogby, founder and current President/CEO of the Utica, New York‚Äìbased polling organization Zogby
            International, New 7 Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on record".[4]

            The program drew a wide range of official reactions. Some countries touted their finalist and tried to get
            more votes cast for it, while others downplayed or criticized the contest.[4][6] After supporting the New 7
            Wonders Foundation at the beginning of the campaign by providing advice on nominee selection, the United
            Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), bound by its bylaws to record and give
            equal status to all World Heritage Sites, distanced itself from the undertaking in 2001 and again in
            2007.[7][8]

                                Ch√°ngch√©ng, literally "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications that
                                were

                                protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were
                                built
                                from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi
                                Huang (220‚Äì206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later

                                many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The
                                best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644).

                                French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva
                                Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe
                                Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres
                                (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft)
                                wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ The
                                Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large

                                organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with
                                the arms spread out wide.

                                Chich√©n Itz√° was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic
                                (c. AD 600‚Äì900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800‚Äì900) and into the early portion
                                of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900‚Äì1200). The site exhibits a multitude of
                                architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and
                                Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was
                                once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from
                                central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these
                                non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.

                                Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest
                                standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the
                                Emperor Vespasian (r.‚Äâ69‚Äì79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor
                                and heir, Titus (r.‚Äâ79‚Äì81).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of
                                Domitian (r.‚Äâ81‚Äì96).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the
                                Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin:
                                Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [a…±fiteÀàaÀêtro ÀàflaÀêvjo]) by later
                                classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).
